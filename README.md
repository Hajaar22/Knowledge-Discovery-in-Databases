# Knowledge-Discovery-in-Databases
This repository contains two data mining projects focused on knowledge discovery from data, applying classical techniques to extract meaningful patterns and predictive insights from categorical datasets.
## Projects

### Association Rules Mining
Implementation of association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets and analyze item co-occurrence patterns in transactional data.

**Techniques used:**
- Association rule mining (unsupervised learning)
- Apriori algorithm
- Support metric
- Transaction encoding (one-hot encoding)

--

### Decision Tree Classification
Application of decision tree classification to predict class labels from categorical features, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

**Techniques used:**
- Decision Tree classification (supervised learning)
- Categorical feature encoding
- Gini impurity
- Entropy (information gain)
- Model evaluation (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Decision tree visualization for interpretability

## Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- mlxtend
- matplotlib
